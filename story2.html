      The Niger State House of Assembly has threatened to shutdown legislative business in the state of the current security situation in the state is nothing immediately addressed, saying that the state is under siege from bandits and other terrorists.
      The assembly specifically called for the immediate rescue of the students of St. Mary's Catholic Missionary School in Papiri, Agwara local government, saying that the current security situation in the state is now at alarming proportion.
      The call by the house follows a motion of urgent public importance brought by the member representing Agwara constituency in the state house of assembly Hon. Mohammed Nura Agwara who described the scene of the abduction of the St. Mary's students pathetic and unfortunate.
       The members were unanimous in their resolutions in condemning the last Friday incident at St. Mary's Catholic missionary school, admitting that the current situation is gradually going out of control.
        The speaker of the house, Rt Hon Abdulmalik Sarkindaji who presided the session, said that the house will not hesitate to shutdown legislative business completely until the necessary steps are taken to address the security situation in the state.

      "Let us not pretend about the current situation. The state is now in the eyes of the world because of security challenges and investors are beginning to turn back from the state, and contractors handling various roads projects have abandoned the sites
      "The current security situation has eroded all the efforts of the present administration in transforming the state. A concrete actions must be taken if not we will have no choice than shutdown legislative business because we are the representatives of the people",
       The speaker who painted a pathetic picture of the security situation in his Mariga Constituency, said over 50 communities, including his political ward have been forced to relocate from their ancestral homes and abandoned their farms.
        "Farmers who usually harvest over hundreds of bags of grains are now begging for food. We can no longer keep quiet because we are the representatives of the people.
        "It is high time we put away our differences and face the current challenges. If schools can be shutdown, markets closed down then we can equally shutdown legislative business until the situation is addressed", the speaker submitted.
